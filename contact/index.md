<h1 class="page-header text-center"> Contact me! </h1>

The easiest way to get in touch with me is by [email](mailto:benjamin.barad+website@gmail.com). Short of that, you can drop me a google hangout at the same address or call me at [310.594.7634](tel:+13105947634). Fair warning: I don't answer my phone often. 

You can also find me online at [twitter](http://twitter.com/benjaminbarad), [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/bbarad), and [github](http://github.com/bbarad).

I am always happy to talk about any and all of the projects I have worked on, as well as any new ideas for the future. In particular, lately I have been thinking about computational methods to make sense of electron density, as well as identifying new ways for scientists to interact with structural data. 

I aim to share all of my work, scientific or otherwise, as publically as possible and would be happy to share anything that is not available on public sources.
