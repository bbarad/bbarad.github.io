bbarad.github.io
================
Freely licensed personal website for Benjamin Barad

## How to clone this website:
1. Fork it and change the repository name to USERNAME.github.io (mine was bbarad, but that won't work for you!)
2. Delete CNAME (you can add a new one later)
3. Delete my publications in _data/publications.yml and add your own, using the existing ones as a template.
4. Update index.md and contact.md
5. Remove my blog posts from _posts and optionally add your own. If you want a blog, uncomment the "blog" lines in _data/navlinks.yml
6. Change the name of the site in _config.yml and in _includes/header.html
7. Change the social media stuff in _includes/footer.html
8. Add new photos and whatnot in static/img and new pdfs in static/pdf
9. Change the name on the atom feed in blog.xml and in _includes/header.html
10. Make an account on Disqus and replace _includes/disqus.html with the relevant information there.
11. Set up google analytics and update it in _includes/footer.html, or remove it completely - it is not very useful!
